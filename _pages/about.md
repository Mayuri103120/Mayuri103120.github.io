📚 I'm a final-year Computer Engineering graduate student at New York University, set to graduate in May 2024.

👩🏽‍💻 I've professionally served as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company, and more recently as an Applied Data Scientist at an ESG-focused supply chain and procurement startup in NY.

💻 I'm skilled in applying Python programming, NLP techniques,  data analysis, visualization, and extraction to bring product visions to life. My proficiency extends to scalable software development, as well as crafting Salesforce CRM solutions. Additionally, I am adept at delving into research endeavors and have made meaningful contributions to an open-source project.

❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about delivering impactful solutions to complex challenges by leveraging technical expertise and systems thinking.

# Work Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
