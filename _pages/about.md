📚 I'm a final-year Computer Engineering graduate student at New York University, set to graduate in May 2024.<br><br>

👩🏽‍💻 I've professionally served as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company, and more recently as an Applied Data Scientist at an ESG-focused supply chain and procurement startup in NY.<br><br>

💻 I'm skilled in applying Python programming, NLP techniques, data analysis, visualization, and extraction to bring product visions to life. My proficiency extends to scalable software development, as well as crafting Salesforce CRM solutions. Additionally, I am adept at delving into research endeavors and have made meaningful contributions to an open-source project.<br><br>

❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about delivering impactful solutions to complex challenges by leveraging technical expertise and systems thinking.

# Work Experience<br><br>

## 🤖 Applied Data Science Intern<br><br> 
### LOCOMeX Inc. | NY, NY | Jun 2023 - Aug 2023<br><br>
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.<br><br>

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.<br><br>
